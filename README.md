baxter_image_recognition
========================

The Baxter Robot from Rethink Robotics is a safe-to-operate robot that can be deployed in an industrial setting. This project consists of using image recognition to classify, pick up, and place objects based on their color or shape.

Specifications / Tasks
======================

To do list in order of priority (please add ideas and details and submit a pull request):

- Ask me if you want a run down of how to use GitHub. Top four buttons on this page are useful https://help.github.com/
- Research C++ image recognition libraries. Look at API differences between different options, balance simple and powerful. Obviously we want color recognition and it would be nice to get coordinates of different colors for example if we were given the color plus the coordinates of the 4 corners of the cube (or up to 7 depending on the angle of the camera) that would be very useful to us.
- Research Baxter Research Software Developement Kit. Documentation found here https://github.com/RethinkRobotics/sdk-docs/wiki). Learn the API, how to move, pick up, work with sensors/camera/motors, how to program, ect
- Find out where our Baxter robot is located and how to get access to it (meet with Roumeliotis, highest priority really but is already in motion)
- Pick up objects in set location and stack them in set location
- Recognize objects based on color (maybe shape and size) and sort them into boxes possibly stacking them.
- Do logging of all major actions (i.e. move to (x1,y1), pick up, move (x2, y2), drop, ect.). Assuming we have the storage neccessary to meet this requirement. 
- Be safe for humans to be nearby (slow down with humans nearby and make sure the path is clear of humans before moving the object to the box)
- Optional: pick up moving objects, different sizes, different shapes.

Timeline
